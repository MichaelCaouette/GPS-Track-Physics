Determine some physics from the GPS data !


Good starting point for reading GPS data with python:
A lot of inspiration from

Florian Wilhelm - Handling GPS Data with Python

And his github repo:

List of update to make for the software:
- Remove outliers: 
	Have a button or list of command to manage the outliers. 
	Maybe also use some sophisticated algorithm to manage it.
