I created a  script "first_chop_analysis_gui.py"
That permits to load and see the GPS trajectory. 
It permits also to chop and isoltae a portion of the data. 
It is a first step, but it requires a couple of refinement for the plotter:
- The 2D plot should update, not multiply (can be fixed by NOT using a databox plot, but just the pyqtGraph interface)
- Same for the 3D trajectory. I should find how to use the pyqt openGL stuff


Next:
- Have different script for:
	- Showing the trajectory (3D, 2D projection, z VS t)
	- Original data + outlier correction + chopping window + chopping button
	- Chopped data + showing + physics infos/calculation + save the data for more analysis ?
	- The window for the physics could have various tabs, one showing the speed and acceleration.
	- Find the map and put it bellow the trajectory?
- Create a GitHub Repository
	- Include also the Diamond-Lab software.

- Ultimately create a .exe files.

I corrected the pyqtgraph replication: I used directly the pyqtgraph plotter. 
And used the function 'clear' to clear the data before adding new. 
Also it saved space. 
Also some fixes for the matplotlib 3D plotter 
(no longer replicated, by using clear and defining the plt.figure() once. 
For the choppinf function, I added some physics computation, like the mean vertical speed. 

Next:
- Different scripts for different mode. 
- More physic computation (some smoothing and fitting maybe? also study the noise)
- Save the chopped data

Now we don't use matplotlib. 
I managed to install and use pyqtgraph and openGL for the 3D rendering. 
It is much more faster ! 

Next:
- Short term:
	- Add a three dictionary for: Scaling, show pts (so we see the sampling). 
	- Outlier removal: None, extrema, algorithm
	- Compute physic with the choped data: max velocity, wind speed, etc. 
- Create a GitHub Repository
	- Include also the Diamond-Lab software.
- Ultimately create a .exe files.

I try to implement the estimation of the wind parameters. 
But the data seems to overestimate the spee. I get speed in the range of 1000km/h !
Hah got it. It was the unit for the time (it was minutes). Now I get a better estimation:
53 km/h for the aircraft (it works with the Daytona wing) and 37 km/h for the wind, which is also possible. 

But this is a very rought estimate, that is not considering velocities. 
If we plot all Vx versus all Vy, the model predicts a circle, and this is what we see ! 
(See the quick result "notebook_progress_2022-10_05 flight velocites.png". 
The center of the circle is the wind vector (wx, wy). And the radius of the circle is the aircraft velocity. 
Obviously, the data points are noisy. The next step is to include the uncertainty in the points and to make 
a Bayesian (or Chi2) fit !
