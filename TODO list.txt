- Find the standard deviation of the GPS data, to get an accruate sense of the uncertainty in the data. 
  This should be done by letting the GPS lay on a surface, and letting it acquiring a lot of pts. 
- Data smoother. Implement the Blabla filter to have smotther data ? HOr just consider the points 
  uncertainties to make the calculation ? I prefer the former.

- Organize the code into:
	- GUI_.py for the GUI
	- calcul_.py for the class that compute physical quantity
	- Make the name of the class and GUI simple for that
